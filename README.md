# T-Pot Honeypot Threat Analysis Project

## üéØ Project Overview
This project documents my deployment and analysis of a T-Pot honeypot system on a cloud-based virtual machine. Over the course of one week, I captured and investigated real-world cyber attacks, documenting threat intelligence findings and attack patterns that demonstrate practical SOC analyst skills.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Cloud infrastructure deployment and management
- Honeypot configuration and monitoring
- Threat intelligence analysis
- Incident documentation and reporting
- Security tool utilization (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Suricata)
- Attack pattern recognition and classification

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Process

### 1. Initial VM Setup
Created a Vultr cloud instance with initial specifications:
- **RAM:** 2GB
- **Storage:** 55GB SSD
- **OS:** Ubuntu Server
- **Location:** New Jersey, USA

*Initial Vultr cloud compute instance*

### 2. SSH Connection & User Configuration
```bash
# SSH into the VM
ssh root@149.28.62.100

# Created new user with admin privileges
sudo adduser aryan
sudo usermod -aG sudo aryan

# Switched to new user
su - aryan
cd ~
```

![SSH Connection](userconsole.jpg)

*SSH terminal connection established*

### 3. T-Pot Installation
```bash
# Clone T-Pot repository
git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce

# Navigate to installation directory
cd tpotce

# Run installer
./install.sh
```

### 4. Installation Configuration
Selected installation type: **HIVE (Full Installation)**
- Includes all honeypots and sensors
- Full distributed setup with WebUI
- Elasticsearch and Kibana for log analysis

![Installation Options](tpotinstallation2.jpg)

*T-Pot installation type selection*

### 5. Network Configuration
Reviewed port mappings and service configurations to ensure proper honeypot exposure:
- Port 64297: T-Pot Web UI (HTTPS)
- Port 64295: SSH management
- Multiple honeypot services on standard ports (22, 23, 80, 443, 8728, etc.)

![Port Configuration](installationsuccessful.jpg)

*Active network ports and service configurations*

### 6. Infrastructure Upgrade
**Challenge:** Initial deployment failed to load web interface properly due to insufficient resources.

**Solution:** Upgraded VM specifications:
- **RAM:** 2GB ‚Üí 8GB
- **Storage:** 55GB ‚Üí 200GB SSD
- Performed system reboot

After upgrade, all services initialized successfully.

### 7. Web Interface Access
Successfully accessed T-Pot dashboard at `https://149.28.62.100:64297`

## ‚úÖ System Validation

### Test Attack - Nmap Port Scan
Verified honeypot functionality by conducting an authorized Nmap scan from my local machine:

```bash
nmap -sV 149.28.62.100
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Honeypot successfully detected and logged the scan
- ‚úÖ Source IP (173.71.120.207) appeared in attack map
- ‚úÖ Multiple honeypots triggered (Honeytrap)
- ‚úÖ All data captured in Kibana logs

## üìä Monitoring & Analysis Tools

### Main Dashboard
The T-Pot dashboard provides real-time visualization of:
- Total honeypot attacks (218 captured in 24 hours)
- Attack distribution by honeypot type
- Geographic attack origins
- Targeted ports and services
- Attack timelines

### Attack Analysis
After just hours of deployment, captured attacks from multiple countries:
- **United States:** 207 attacks
- **Netherlands:** 2 attacks
- Multiple attack vectors detected (SSH, port scanning, RouterOS exploitation)

## üîç Next Steps: Threat Intelligence Analysis

Now that the honeypot is operational and capturing real-world attacks, I plan to:

1. **Monitor daily** for 1-2 weeks to capture diverse attack patterns
2. **Investigate 10 unique incidents** using threat intelligence sources:
   - AbuseIPDB - Check abuse confidence scores and report history
   - GreyNoise - Identify mass scanners vs. targeted attacks
   - VirusTotal - Check security vendor detections
3. **Document findings** in detailed incident reports with:
   - Attack timeline and detection details
   - Threat intelligence analysis
   - MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
   - IOC extraction
   - Recommended response actions
4. **Analyze attack patterns** to identify trends in threat actor behavior

**Investigation reports will be added to the `/incidents` directory as they are completed.**

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Real-World Threat Landscape:** Within hours, honeypot was bombarded with automated attacks targeting SSH, RouterOS, and other services
2. **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Learned to correlate honeypot data with external threat feeds
3. **Attack Pattern Recognition:** Identified difference between automated scanning vs. targeted attacks
4. **Cloud Security Operations:** Gained hands-on experience with cloud-based security infrastructure
5. **SOC Analyst Workflow:** Practiced incident triage, investigation, and documentation
